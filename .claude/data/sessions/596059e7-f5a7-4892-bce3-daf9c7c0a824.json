So either use reading certain amounts of lines or whatever way you think is best to read such a large file. Our goal is to split this file up into smaller parts so that they can be more easily read by future AI agents, but also so we can update certain sections more easily rather than appending to the end of it. I don't want you to use your own rewriting tool. Don't use that. I would like you to create a Python script that will shard this document instead. Create a new directory for handling this project. ",
