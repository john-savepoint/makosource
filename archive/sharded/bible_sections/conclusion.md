# CONCLUSION

This document provides everything needed to implement native Japanese text rendering in Final Fantasy VII via the FFNx driver. The system is:

- ✅ **Production-proven** (based on Square Enix's AF3DN.P architecture)
- ✅ **Legally sound** (clean-room reimplementation)
- ✅ **Community-friendly** (open source, MIT licensed)
- ✅ **Future-proof** (extensible for multi-language, Furigana, etc.)
- ✅ **Backward compatible** (English mode unaffected)

**Success Criteria:**
- Japanese characters render correctly (no squashing)
- All 6 font pages load and switch dynamically
- No crashes or memory corruption
- Performance overhead < 5%
- Works with both ff7_en.exe and ff7_ja.exe

**Developer Support:**

If you encounter issues during implementation:

1. **Check FFNx.log** - Most issues are logged with clear errors
2. **Use debugger** - Verify addresses and logic flow
3. **Consult this document** - All known issues documented
4. **Community support** - Qhimm Forums, FFNx Discord
5. **GitHub Issues** - Report bugs to FFNx repository

**Good luck with your implementation!**
