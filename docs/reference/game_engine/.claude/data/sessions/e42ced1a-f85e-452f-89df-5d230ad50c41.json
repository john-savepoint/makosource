I want you to put or create new sections for the content unique to major sections, so that valuable content that exists only in the major sections. Please extract that and name it appropriately so it fits in with the rest of the other files, but also update the `ff7.md`, which is a table of contents file. Please read any one of the other markdowns to see the format that they are written in and how they have a table of contents. We need this to integrate into this well. ",

Could we in parallel run five at a time of comparing the individual files against the major section that you created in the mapping markdown. Or at least maybe just tell me if you can do that first and then provide me a plan for how you plan to execute that so we get an effective cross-referencing between the two files, the individual and the major section, and that we know we're going to actually do this to all 32 files.
