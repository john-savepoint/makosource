MERGE METADATA
Created: 2025-11-29
Original: FF7_PSX_Sound_INSTRxALL.md (12 lines)
Major section: None (Sound formats not in major sections)
Merge decision: NO EXTRACTION PERFORMED
Reason: INSTR format documentation is complete and self-contained
Status: COMPLETE - Original file copied as source of truth

Standardization Changes Applied:
- Added YAML frontmatter with LLM routing metadata
- Added HTML comment metadata block with standardization history
- Fixed heading hierarchy: Removed wiki-style anchor syntax from H1 and H2
- Removed non-functional wiki-style TOC with custom anchors
- Converted wiki-style anchor links to standard markdown format
- Added cross-references to related Sound module documentation
- Added technical context section for better navigability

v2.0 Cleanup Changes Applied:
- Converted inline notes to GitHub-flavored markdown alerts
- Added consistent code formatting for hex values and file paths
- Improved table alignment for better readability

LLM CONTEXT BLOCK (Read this first for routing decisions):
This document specifies the binary format of INSTR.ALL and INSTR2.ALL files found on FF7 PSX
game discs. These files contain raw PSX ADPCM audio sample data for all game instruments
(93 in INSTR.ALL, 4 vocal samples in INSTR2.ALL for "One Winged Angel"). The data is loaded
via DMA directly to SPU RAM at offset 0x0202. Related documentation covers the instrument
metadata (INSTRx.DAT) and the AKAO sequence format that references these samples.

# FF7/PSX/Sound/INSTRx.ALL

## Overview

There are two files of this structure on FF7 game discs:

| File         | Location              | Contents                                             |
|:-------------|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| `INSTR.ALL`  | `SOUND/INSTR.ALL`     | Main game sounds (93 instruments)                    |
| `INSTR2.ALL` | `SOUND/INSTR2.ALL`    | Voices from ending theme "One Winged Angel" (4 instruments) |

These files contain all sample data for every instrument in the game. Every instrument consists of 16-byte PSX ADPCM frames. The frame format is well-documented and numerous decompressors exist, including implementations in the Q-Gears source code.

## File Structure

### Header Format

At the file beginning there are two 32-bit numbers:

| Offset | Size    | Description                              |
|-------:|:--------|:-----------------------------------------|
| `0x00` | 4 bytes | Unknown (related to SPU memory offset)   |
| `0x04` | 4 bytes | Offset of last ADPCM frame in file       |

### Sample Data

Starting from offset `0x20`, the file contains sample data for all instruments.

> [!NOTE]
> **Terminology**: The term "Instrument" refers to a series of ADPCM samples. In some contexts, the terms "Sample", "Sound", or "Voice" may be used interchangeably to describe an instrument.

### Memory Loading

All data from `INSTR.ALL` is loaded by DMA to SPU RAM in one chunk at offset `0x0202`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The loading behavior for `INSTR2.ALL` has not yet been fully documented.
