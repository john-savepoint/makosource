# LLM-specific metadata (CRITICAL for routing)
llm_summary: "Provides high-level overview of the PSX FF7 sound system architecture, including the distinction between streaming audio (XA-ADPCM) and custom tracker-based sound. LLMs should read this when investigating FF7 audio playback, sound format questions, or understanding the relationship between PSX SPU hardware and FF7's custom sound implementation."

LLM CONTEXT BLOCK (Read this first for routing decisions):
This document provides the foundational overview of FF7's PlayStation sound system. It explains that
FF7 uses two distinct audio approaches: streaming XA-ADPCM for video sequences and a custom Square
Enix tracker format (not standard PSX SEQ/VAB/VAG). For detailed format specifications, see the
related AKAO frames and INSTRx documentation. This overview is the entry point for understanding
FF7's audio architecture before diving into specific format details.

# FF7/PSX/Sound/Overview

## Overview

PSX FF7 sound system is tightly connected with PSX SPU implementation. There are 2 main types of sounds in FF7: streaming sound (background noise in video sequences) and tracker sound. Square Enix programmers didn't use any standard PSX formats such as SEQ, VAB & VAG, they wrote their own custom tracker. Streaming sound is standard PSX XA-ADPCM format, all sound streaming data is in Mode 2 sectors on FF7 CDROM game discs.
