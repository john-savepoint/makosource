### Version History

| Version | Date     | Notes                                            |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| v0.8    | 23/03/02 | Original Release - Not accompanied by sister guides |

### Foreword

These guides have been a long time in the making.

It started with a webpage. Just a small private one that I created early in April 1999. It was more practice than anything else, and I put up most of my findings about the game at that time. Most of it was incorrect, but I had some basics down.

I changed to pure text format soon after when I realized that a webpage was very difficult to update with the number of tables such a Mechanics document requires. Pure text is also a lot easier to simply add stuff to. Updates can be made in seconds.

But this was still a private thing. It's been private for years, in fact. But that's not to say it wasn't added to or the information wasn't utilized.

During this time, I've met many people who share the same fascination that I have with this subject. We've helped each other too; some of the information included here is due to information that was pointed out to me in the memory dumps. I've learned from it, I've progressed. And the guide grew.

Recently, it's become more and more apparent that this kind of information is not only useful, but also in demand. True, it doesn't help the average player, whose only concern is to get from A to B without too much trouble and just having fun along the way... but to others, it's fun to learn how the game works, and exactly what makes the monsters they fight tick.

As such, I have finally managed to complete this to my satisfaction. It may not be finished yet, and I may not ever find the time to update it so that it is complete... but at least it is whole.

And this is it.

> [!NOTE]
> **NOTE (23/03/0003):** This isn't a finished product. It may never be a finished product. As it stands, only this guide of the three planned is being released. Please do not e-mail asking on the progress of the other two; the Battle Mechanics guide is being released now as something to work on. The other two will follow when they're structurally complete, and not before.

### Component Guides

*The FF7 Game Mechanics Guides* are split into three files. This guide, the first, will detail the basic formulas, terms and statuses used in battle. The other two are:

**The FF7 Party Mechanics**
: Covers the various battle formulas relating to the party, notably formulas regarding spell damage, materia use, and limit breaks.

**The FF7 Enemy Mechanics**
: A list of enemies focusing on their attacks and attributes, and how the damage from those attacks are factored into the battle mechanics formulas.

The FF7 Battle Mechanics is the main one to start with, since it will define many terms that will be used in both Party and Enemy Mechanics.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide is based on the PC version. While most alleged gameplay differences between the PC and PSX versions have been proven false, more may exist.

## 1. Definitions

### 1.1 Character Stats

There are seven **Primary Stats** and seven **Derived Stats** that make up your basic character.

#### Primary Stats

| Abbrev | Full Name  | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Str    | Strength   | Physical power |
| Dex    | Dexterity  | Agility and speed |
| Vit    | Vitality   | Physical endurance |
| Mag    | Magic      | Magical power |
| Spr    | Spirit     | Magical resistance |
| Lck    | Luck       | Affects critical hits, evasion |
| Lvl    | Level      | Overall power level |

#### Derived Stats

| Abbrev | Full Name   | Derivation Formula |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Atk    | Attack      | Str + Weapon Attack Bonus |
| At%    | Attack%     | Weapon Attack% Bonus |
| Def    | Defense     | Vit + Armour Defense Bonus |
| Df%    | Defense%    | (Dex / 4) + Armour Defense% Bonus |
| MAt    | Magic Atk   | Magic |
| MDf    | Magic Def   | Spirit + Armour MDefense Bonus |
| MD%    | Magic Def%  | Armour MDefense% Bonus |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Known Bug:** There is a bug in FF7 such that Armour MDefense Bonus is **not** added to Magic Def. This is reflected in many places, including the Status screen (but the bonus you are supposed to get is visible in the Equip screen). To my knowledge, it is definitely evident in both the PC version and the PSX version. You will take the same amount of magic damage regardless of your Armour's MDefense rating.

The Primary Stats dictate the overall strengths of your character. Level dictates exactly how powerful the character is, while the last six stats round off the character. Each character has a starting value for their Primary Stats, and every level, there is a chance that these stats will be raised by a random number of points. In addition, it's possible to further raise these stats permanently using Sources.

Your Derived Stats, along with a few of the Primary Stats (mostly Level and Luck), are what's used in every battle to determine battle damage, spell strength, and so on.

In addition to the above, many pieces of armour, weaponry and accessories will give you special bonuses to your Primary Stats which, in turn, affect your Derived Stats. You can only see these bonuses in effect on the Status screen though, not on the Equip screen. These bonuses are factored into battle, however.

From now on, the three letter abbreviations next to each Stat will be used instead of their full names.

### 1.2 Special Term Definitions

The following terms will be used throughout the Game Mechanics guides.

#### 1.2.1 Basic Terms

**Base Damage**
: A special term which means the basic power of most basic types of attack. For physical attacks, Base Damage is dependent on Atk and Lvl. For magical attacks, it is dependent on MAt and Lvl. Most attacks will use Base Damage to determine the damage they do. In ability formulas, this will be listed as `Base`.

**NRV**
: Short for **N**o **R**andom **V**ariation, this means that the attack will not vary in power according to a random factor.

**Caster**
: The character that used the ability. Also known as the source of the attack's effect.

**Target**
: The character that is affected by the ability.

**BD (Before Defense) Modifier**
: This term applied to quite a number of abilities. The primary use for BD Modifiers is for Ultimate Weapons. In this case, the name which has been given to them is UW Modifier. As of writing, only one BD Modifier is known that is not connected to Ultimate Weapons, but the distinction, however slim, still stands. All BD Modifiers take the form of a fraction with a denominator of 16 (e.g., 3/16). See below for details.

**UW (Ultimate Weapon) Modifier**
: A subset of BD Modifiers. UW Modifiers are for Ultimate Weapons only. They are separated for clarity. Take note that UW Modifiers are only applied to Base Command skills: Attack, 2x-Cut, 4x-Cut, Slash-All, Mug, Morph and D.blow.

**Added Damage Effect**
: This term applies to certain weapons and abilities. It is a modifier that is multiplied to the damage during damage calculations. See below for details.

**Element**
: Some attacks will use a special Element that will determine certain factors about the attack. Most enemies will have certain elemental weaknesses and strength; this factor will determine whether the attack will do extra damage or be defended against. For example, an attack described as 'Elm: Fire' will do Fire Elemental damage.

#### Common Elements

FF7 uses the following common Elements:

| Standard Elements | | | |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Fire | Ice | Lightning | Earth |
| Poison | Gravity | Water | Wind |
| Holy | Restorative | | |

The absence of any Element is termed **Non-Element**, which, while not technically an element in itself, will be used to denote this state.

There are also five more Elements that apply only to Physical Attacks. While FF7 is aware of them, they are not normally utilized in Elemental calculations because almost nothing is weak or defends against them:

| Physical-Only Elements | | |
|------------------------|-------|-------|
| Cut | Hit | Punch |
| Shoot | Shout | |

And finally, there is a 16th Hidden Element that was obviously supposed to have been dummied out, but due to sloppy coding, has ended up having unexpected effects with the Elemental Materia and certain attacks.

> **Hidden Element**

Of the above Elements, Restorative, Cut, Hit, Punch, Shoot, Shout and Hidden are not made known to the player:

| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Restorative | The difference between the Cure and Life series of spells which give back HP, and the Holy Elemental attack spells like Alexander, which cause Holy Element damage. While Undead are often said to be Weak to Holy, they **Absorb** Restorative instead. |
| Cut         | Used to describe an attack that uses an edged weapon. |
| Hit         | Used to describe an attack that uses a blunt weapon. |
| Punch       | Used to describe an attack that uses a piercing weapon. |
| Shoot       | Used to describe attacks that use projectile weapons. |
| Shout       | Used to describe attacks that are sonic or energy-based in nature. |
| Hidden      | Unknown. Unlike the others, Hidden is the name I've given it. Very few attacks have this element. Any that do can be protected from by linking any non-Element Materia with the Elemental Materia in a character's armor. |

#### 1.2.2 Types of Attack

When an attack type is given, the following terms will be used to describe them. These are the most common terms; unique terms will be described within the notes for the appropriate ability itself.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Physical** | Any attack termed as Physical will use Atk and Def as the primary damage calculating stats, and is affected by Barrier. It will also normally use the Physical Formula for Base Damage, unless noted otherwise. |
| **Magical** | Any attack termed as Magical will use MAt and MDf as the primary damage calculating stats, and is affected by MBarrier. It will also normally use the Magical Formula for Base Damage, unless noted otherwise. |
| **Piercing** | This means that the attack will ignore the target's Defense and Magic def stats when determining how much damage it will do to them. |
| **Attack** | Any attack with this modifier will cause damage to some stat. By default, this is HP, but this can be modified. For example, MP Attack would mean an ability that reduces the target's MP. |
| **Absorb** | The same as Attack, except that the caster benefits in some way from the damage given to the target. Unless otherwise noted, the benefit is equal and opposite to the damage dealt. |
| **LR** | Short for **L**ong **R**ange, this means that the ability will not factor Back Row modifiers into the formula. Thus, the ability will do full damage no matter the distance. This also means the ability can target enemies that are 'Can't reach'. |
| **Restore** | Restorative is a special Element that has the damage rules for Elements reversed. With no Restorative affinity, targets will gain HP or MP from this Element. However, targets that Absorb Restorative will take damage instead. |
| **Recovery** | A special type of attack that will completely refill the target's HP and MP. If it has an Element, then against any target that Absorbs the ability's Element, it will inflict Death status instead. The words 'Recovery' or 'Death' will flash up over the target. |
| **Change Status** | This attack type attempts to change the statuses on a target. Changes are divided into three types: Cure, Inflict or Toggle. A number in square brackets indicates the relative chance of success (e.g., [15] Inflict 'Death' is a Rating 15 chance of inflicting Death Status). Think of the Rating as approximately a chance out of 64. If the chance reads [63], then the Status Chance is as near to 100% as it gets. |
| **Misc** | Any ability that is not adequately described by the above categories falls under this category by default. |

#### 1.2.3 Target Types

Any ability used will often require a target to be given. The following shorthand will be used:

| Abbrev | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Op | Opponent |
| Al | Ally |
| Tar | Target (Opponent or Ally) |

**1 Tar**
: This means that the ability can only hit one selected target. Multi-hit attacks that only hit one selected target also fall under this category.

**n Tar**
: This special variation means that the ability will hit n randomly selected targets in the chosen target group. For example, Omnislash will be listed as '15 Op', which means it will hit 15 randomly selected targets in a selected opponent target group.

**All Tar**
: This means that the ability will hit all targets within the selected target group once each. If this Target Type is used, the strength of the ability must be multiplied by 2/3; that strength is then used to determine the damage for each single target. If there is only one Target in the group, then the ability is used at full strength instead (counted as a 1 Tar attack).

**All Tar (NS)**
: NS stands for **N**o **S**plit. This means that the strength of the ability is NOT multiplied by 2/3 when used against All Targets. It will do full damage to each and every single target.

**Area**
: This means that the entire battlefield is a valid target for the ability. Both the party and the enemies will be affected.

**Random**
: This means that the target will be a randomly selected single target out of a valid group. Similar to n Tar, except that the valid group is what's being specified. Random [All] specifies a single random target out of a single target group. Random [Area] specifies a single random target out of all valid target groups in battle.

#### 1.2.4 Equipment Modifiers

The following terms will be used as shorthand to describe various modifiers equipment and accessories may give.

**+?? Stat**
: This indicates that wearing the given equipment will give the indicated bonus to the described Basic Stat.

**Half/Void/Absorb Elemental**
: The equipment will automatically allow you to either Halve, Void or Absorb damage from the relevant Elements. If you have a better Elemental Defense than the one given, it will not be affected; the better Defense automatically takes priority.

**Immune Status**
: Wearing this equipment will automatically make you immune to the given Status. Note that Immunity is really a Resist. If you are Immune to that Status, then it is also impossible to Cure that Status should you have it on you. This is best shown by wearing a Ribbon and using a Hyper outside of battle; you will gain the 'Fury' Status, but nothing will be able to remove that Status while you are inside battle.

**Start with Status**
: This means that wearing the piece of equipment will make sure you begin each battle with the named Status(es). You cannot protect yourself from this initial infliction.

## 2. Basic Damage Formulae

First, it is important that you are familiar with the `[x]` convention:

> `[x]` = the greatest integer equal to or less than x
> Thus, `[4.5]` would be 4.

This convention will be used throughout the guides, and is very important for battle damage.

In addition, you should be familiar with the following convention:

> `x ... y` = an integer random number between x and y inclusive
> For example, `3 ... 8` would be a random number out of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Finally, a function `Rnd` is defined here, since it is also required by this guide:

> `Rnd` picks a random number between 0 and 1 inclusive. The precision of accuracy Rnd uses is not yet known.

### The Base Damage Formulas

The Base Damage formula is the most important battle formula in the game.

#### Physical Formula

```
Base Damage = Atk + [(Atk + Lvl) / 32] × [(Atk × Lvl) / 32]
```

#### Magical Formula

```
Base Damage = 6 × (MAt + Lvl)
```

> [!NOTE]
> While Atk and MAt are used in the above formulas, it is possible for FF7 abilities to be coded to use each formula with the opposite attack stat (using MAt instead of Atk in the Physical Formula, for instance). However, this is purely academic, since no known ability has been found within the game code that does this.

---

## 3. Battle Damage

Now that the basic terms and formulae have been covered, the basic battle process of determining damage can be defined. Note that certain abilities may skip certain aspects of this procedure; for example, Mindblow will never need to work out either Base Damage, DefMod or Random Variation, because it is a Piercing attack with NRV, and uses a formula that doesn't need Base.

### Step 1: Define Negative Damage

A boolean flag named 'Negative Damage' shall be defined at this point. The only factor it checks at this stage is whether the attack contains the Restorative Element. If it does, then Negative Damage is true. Otherwise, it begins as false. The purpose of this flag shall become clear later.

### Step 2: Find Base Damage

First, for most attacks, Base Damage must be worked out. If the formula used for the ability does not use Base, then this part may be skipped. The Base Damage formulae are listed in the previous section, and depend on whether the attack is Physical or Magical.

If the character is 'Small', then Base Damage must be worked out with `Atk = 0`.

Finally, the character's Physical Base Mod and Magical Base Mod are checked. Hero Drinks (as an example) raise both of these by 30 each time you drink them, to a maximum of 100.

**If the attack is physical:**
```
Base Damage = [Base Damage × (100 + Physical Base Mod) / 100]
```

**If the attack is magical:**
```
Base Damage = [Base Damage × (100 + Magical Base Mod) / 100]
```

### Step 3: Use the Appropriate Formula

Next, the formula for the attack is worked out. This is usually either an independent formula or a multiple of Base. This gives us the power of the attack. FF7 has several formulas that it may use:

- Physical Base Damage Formula × Power of Attack
- Magical Base Damage Formula × Power of Attack
- Percentage of Target's HP
- Percentage of Target's Max HP
- Magical Formula + Power of Attack (the Cure Formula)
- Fixed Power of Attack
- Recovery
- Special Formulas (e.g., Chocobuckle uses the number of times the party has escaped from battle)

Many abilities will have either the Non-Damaging formula or a Power of 0. Thus, they may skip this part, since these are generally abilities that change statuses or do other non-damage related abilities. Element checking may still take place to determine success of certain abilities.

At this point:
```
dam = [dam]
```

### Step 4: Factor in the BD (Before Defense) Modifiers

BD Modifiers are factored in now, since they're a measure of your base damage. Note that UW (Ultimate Weapon) Modifiers are classified as BD Modifiers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BD Modifiers on weapons **ONLY** take effect if the ability used is a BASE Command skill. These commands are: Attack, 2x-Cut, 4x-Cut, Slash-All, Mug, Morph and D.blow. Limit, Magic, Summon, Item and E.Skill are exempt (an Ultimate Weapon will not lend its added damage capability to a Limit Break).

When combining two BD Modifiers (e.g., using Morph with most Ultimate Weapons):

```
New BDM = [(BD1 × BD2 × 16) + (15 / 16)] / 16
```

What we're actually doing is multiplying two BD Modifiers together, then rounding **up** to the nearest 1/16th. For example:

```
9/16 × 2/16 = 18/256 = 9/128  →  rounds up to 2/16 or 1/8
```

Using the formula to check:
```
New BDM = [(9/16 × 2/16 × 16) + (15/16)] / 16
        = [(9 × 2/16) + 15/16] / 16
        = [18/16 + 15/16] / 16
        = [33/16] / 16
        = [2 + 1/16] / 16
        = 2/16
```

By going through the BD Modifiers, you should eventually end up with one final BD Modifier:
```
dam = [BD Modifier × dam]
```

### Step 5: Calculate All Tar if Appropriate

Attacks that target All Targets are granted a modification now. If the attack is No Split (listed as All Tar (NS)), then this section is skipped. In addition, if there is only 1 target in the group, then this section is skipped (it counts as if it was only used against 1 Tar instead).

Whether an ability is No Split or not depends on the formula and valid target data for the ability in question. Attacks that use the Physical Formula will always split their damage (they can never have the No Split ability). Attacks that use the Magical Formula are only No Split if they cannot be switched between All Tar and 1 Tar. Any ability that works with the All Materia will thus automatically be denied No Split. The exception here is the Cure Formula, which always splits no matter what the valid target data. The rest of the formulas will generally be No Split, but exceptions will be noted.

If the attack is not No Split:
```
dam = [dam × 2 / 3]
```

### Step 6: Calculate Quadra Magic if Available

If the ability is linked to Quadra Magic and Quadra Magic works with it, then:
```
dam = [dam / 2]
```

This happens no matter what, unless the ability does not do any kind of damage or healing. (Demi and FullCure are affected as well)

### Step 7: Calculate Defense

Defense comes next, if warranted. If the attack is Piercing, then this part is ignored. If the attack is Physical, then the target's Def stat is used; otherwise, if the attack is Magical, the MDf stat is used.

The Defense Mod and MDefense Mod of the character is checked at this point. This is a special battle-only stat that is modified by Hero Drinks and Dragon Force (as examples). Each Hero Drink raises both Mods by 30. Each Dragon Force raises both Mods by 50. Neither Mod can ever exceed 100.

**If attack is Physical:**
```
DefNum = [Def × (100 + Defense Mod) / 100]
```

**If attack is Magical:**
```
DefNum = [MDf × (100 + MDefense Mod) / 100]
```

**Apply the damage reduction:**
```
dam = [dam × (512 - DefNum) / 512]
```

### Step 8: Calculate Berserk and Critical Strike

If the character is in 'Berserk' and the ability uses a Physical Base, then:
```
dam = [dam × 1.5]
```

Critical Strikes and Deathblow damage are also done at this point. If the attack is a Critical Strike (either through luck, via the Deathblow command, the Lucky Girl status, or any other move that has automatic Criticals), and the ability uses a Physical Base then:
```
dam = dam × 2
```

### Step 9: Frog Check

At this point, after Critical Strike, if the Caster is a 'Frog' and the attack utilises Physical Base Damage, then:
```
dam = [dam / 4]
```

### Step 10: MP Turbo Check

MP Turbo also gets a look in at this point if the ability is compatible and is currently paired with the requisite Materia. Depending on the level of the MP Turbo Materia, damage is adjusted accordingly:
```
dam = [dam × (1 + (MP Turbo Level / 10))]
```

### Step 11: Back Row Check

Back Row modifier occurs now. If the attack is Magical or is Long Range, then this part is ignored. If either the Caster or the Target is in the back row, then:
```
dam = [dam / 2]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above applies even if attacking an ally or even yourself. It is only applied once though; you will do 1/2 rather than 1/4 damage if you attack yourself with a non-LR physical attack while in the back row.

### Step 12: Barrier and MBarrier Check

Barrier and MBarrier are now looked at.

If the target has **Barrier** and the attack is Physical and does not have the No Barrier attribute:
```
dam = [dam / 2]
```

If the target has **MBarrier** and the attack is Magical and does not have the No Barrier attribute:
```
dam = [dam / 2]
```

Generally, only the Physical Formula, the Magical Formula and the Cure Formula attacks are affected by Barrier and MBarrier. The rest will usually be No Barrier. Exceptions will be noted.

### Step 13: Sadness Check

Sadness is skipped if the ability is NRV, a Restore or from an Item.

If the target has the Status 'Sadness', then the damage is modified accordingly:
```
dam = dam - [dam × 79 / 256]
```

### Step 14: Random Variation Factored In

If the ability being used is listed as NRV, then we skip this part:
```
dam = [dam × (15 + Rnd) / 16]
```

### Step 15: Lower Bound Sanity Check

Lower bound sanity checking takes place at this point:
```
If (dam < 1) Then: dam = 1
```

Damage greater than 9999 is left unchanged at this point.

### Step 16: Added Damage Effects

Added Damage Effects are now done. These are simple integer multipliers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Added Damage Effects on weapons, like BD Modifiers above, **ONLY** take effect if the ability used is a BASE Command skill. No doubling up of Yoshiyuki with Goblin Punch, for example.

For all Added Damage Effects that must be done:
```
dam = dam × Added Damage Effect
```

### Step 17: Elemental Damage and Final Status Checks

Finally, Elemental Damage and Final Status Checks takes place. Once one Elemental is found in the order of priority, the others will be skipped.

> [!NOTE]
> Poison Element is special; if you're Immune to the status, then you also count as being Immune to the element (but Absorb: Poison will always be checked first).

Within this section, checks against Shield, Peerless and certain special abilities of enemies are also made. The order of these checks is not certain, so no attempt will be made to integrate them into the Elemental system below.

Also, any Elemental affinity the player has on their weapon is only taken into consideration for base Command abilities. You can't have a Fire-element Omnislash, for example, or Throw Gravity-element Mythril Sabers.

**Elemental Priority Order:**

1. **Absorb:** If the target Absorbs one of the Elements of the attack, the Negative Damage flag is toggled (if Negative Damage was true, it's now false; and vice versa).

2. **Void:** If the target doesn't Absorb any of the Elements, but does Void it:
   ```
   dam = 0
   ```

3. **Half:** If the target doesn't Absorb or Void any of the Elements, but does Half it:
   ```
   dam = [(dam + 1) / 2]
   ```

4. **Weak:** If the target hasn't Absorbed, Voided or Halved any of the Elements already:
   ```
   dam = dam × 2
   ```

### Step 18: The 9999 Sanity Check

After all this, only one thing remains.

**For HP damage:**
```
If (dam > 9999) Then: dam = 9999
```

**For MP damage (without HP<->MP Materia):**
```
If (dam > 999) Then: dam = 999
```

> [!NOTE]
> The 999 'Sanity Check' is also used if the target **does** have 'HP<->MP' equipped and the damage is dealt to HP instead of MP (the 'HP<->MP' Materia not only reverses HP and MP, but it also reverses the max damage allowed against that target).

### Step 19: Negative Damage

The final damage has, at that point, been calculated. All that remains is to check the status of the Negative Damage flag.

- If **Negative Damage is true**, then the amount 'dam' will be **healed** to the target. The type of the attack will define what exactly is healed.
- If **Negative Damage is false**, then the amount 'dam' will be used as **damage** against the target's appropriate stat (usually HP).

### Battle Damage Summary

The above sequence can be summarized as:

| Step | Check |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Small Check |
| 2 | Base Formula |
| 3 | Hero Drink Check |
| 4 | BD Modifier |
| 5 | All Tar Reduction |
| 6 | Quadra Magic |
| 7 | Defense |
| 8 | Berserk / Critical Strike |
| 9 | Frog Check |
| 10 | MP Turbo Check |
| 11 | Back Row / Long Range |
| 12 | Barrier / MBarrier |
| 13 | Sadness Check |
| 14 | Random Variation |
| 15 | Damage < 1 |
| 16 | Added Damage Effects |
| 17 | Elemental Damage and Final Status Checks |
| 18 | Damage > 9999 |
| 19 | Negative Damage |

> [!NOTE]
> This order may not be 100% accurate. There are too many combinations of factors to test them all, and without seeing the code for the battle algorithms, a lot of what is displayed here are educated guesses derived from results seen. It is presumed accurate enough for 99% of all results at this present time.

## 4. Statuses

There are **31 major Statuses** in the game, although a few of them are not shown on the Status screen and are sometimes transparent to the user:

| | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Death | Near-death | Sleep | Poison | Sadness | Fury | Confusion | Silence |
| Haste | Slow | Stop | Frog | Small | Slow-numb | Petrify | Regen |
| Barrier | MBarrier | Reflect | Shield | Death-sentence | Manipulate | Berserk | Peerless |
| Paralysed | Darkness | Dual | Death Force | Resist | Lucky Girl | Imprisoned | |

Of those, Death Force, Resist and Lucky Girl are nearly transparent to the player, and a few of the others (like Imprisoned) are completely invisible save for their effect.

**Not listed on Status screen:** Dual, Death Force, Resist, Lucky Girl, Imprisoned

What follows is a breakdown of the statuses' visual effects and gameplay attributes.

### 4.1 Status Attributes

#### Death

The ultimate offensive Status Attribute. If you're successfully hit with it, you are immediately reduced to 0 HP. Death is also the state of having 0 HP.

You can protect from 'Sudden Death' (any attack that causes you to instantly die, regardless of how much HP you have). However, if you are reduced to 0 HP by taking too much damage, you can't protect against that.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character lies down |
| **Effects** | Character flagged as 'Dead'. Removes all Statuses except 'Frog' and 'Small' |
| **Duration** | Until cured |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Safety Bit, Destruct+Added Effect, Odin+Added Effect, Death Force |
| **Cured by** | Life, Life2, Phoenix Down, Angel Whisper, Phoenix |

#### Near-Death

When your character is heavily wounded but still able to fight, they are classed as Near-death. They kneel down and their HP indicator turns yellow.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character kneels |
| **Effects** | None |
| **Duration** | Until cured |
| **Protected by** | Anything that prevents HP loss |
| **Cured by** | Anything that boosts your HP above 25% of Max HP |

#### Sleep

One of four temporary 'Can't Act' Status Attributes. Once under this Status, the character is asleep and cannot fight normally. However, Sleep is easily reversed; any Physical hit is enough to wake up a sleeping character.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character kneels/has Zzz above head |
| **Effects** | Character cannot Act |
| **Duration** | 26 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Headband, Seal+Added Effect, Hades+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Any Physical Hit, Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper |

#### Poison

Any character inflicted with this Status will continually take Poison Elemental damage throughout the battle. It won't be purged naturally until the battle ends.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character kneels/flashes Green |
| **Effects** | Character takes [1/32 of Max HP] of Physical Poison Elemental damage every 2.5 units of time (ignores Def, Barrier and is NRV) |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Poison Ring, Star Pendant, Fairy Ring, Poison+Added Effect, Hades+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Poisona, Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper, Antidote |

> [!NOTE]
> The Status Attribute Poison is different from the Element Poison. If you Void or Absorb Poison Elemental, any attack that does Poison damage will no longer inflict the Poison Attribute. However, you will still be vulnerable to things like Bad Breath, which causes various Status Attributes without causing damage. The reverse also has effects; being Immune to the Status Attribute Poison will mean that you are also considered Immune to the element.

#### Sadness

A character inflicted with Sadness is more subdued and careful in battle. They take less damage from attacks, but find it difficult to get angry. Hence, the growth of their Limit Bar is severely reduced.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Limit bar is blue |
| **Effects** | Character takes approximately 177/256× damage from most attacks (see Section 3), Limit Bar growth halved |
| **Duration** | Until cured |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Peace Ring |
| **Cured by** | Hyper, Esuna, Remedy |

#### Fury

Anyone in Fury status is more prone to rushing the enemy and attacking them with greater fervour. They get an increase in Limit Bar growth, allowing more frequent Limit Breaks. However, their attacks are more erratic and miss more often.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Limit bar is red |
| **Effects** | Character Attack% reduced. Limit Bar growth doubled |
| **Duration** | Until cured |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Peace Ring |
| **Cured by** | Tranquilizer, Esuna, Remedy |

#### Confusion

The pure opposite of Berserk. You immediately lose control of the character, and they will randomly attack their allies, even themselves. A single Physical hit will cure it. However, a recently Confused character will always carry out the last command they were asked to, but against you.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character continually spins in place |
| **Effects** | Character randomly attacks allies |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Peace Ring, Contain+Added Effect, Mystify+Added Effect, Hades+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Any Physical Hit, Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper |

#### Silence

While under its influence, you are unable to cast any Magic, Enemy Skills or Summons. However, your other commands are untouched. Its usefulness lies in using it on the enemy; many have attacks that would be better left sealed with Silence.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character kneels/has speech bubble over head |
| **Effects** | Character cannot use Magic/Enemy Skills/Summons |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Seal+Added Effect, Hades+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper, Echo Screen |

#### Haste

One of the best Status Attributes. Haste has your time bar filling up twice as fast as normal. However, all timed effects like Slow-numb, Barrier and so forth, will run out twice as quickly. But the pros far outweigh the cons.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character Animation speed doubled |
| **Effects** | Time Unit speed doubled |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist' |
| **Cured by** | DeSpell |

#### Slow

The complete opposite of Haste. Slow causes your time bar to fill up twice as slow as normal. But it has its good side; Barrier, MBarrier, Slow-numb, Death-sentence... all take far longer to run out.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character Animation speed halved |
| **Effects** | Time Unit speed halved |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Time+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | DeSpell, White Wind, Angel Whisper |

#### Stop

The second worst of the four temporary 'Can't Act' Status Attributes. Stop completely shuts off the Time counter for that character. However, things like Barrier, MBarrier, Regen and so on will not count down during this time, until Stop has worn off or been dispelled.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character Animation speed paused |
| **Effects** | Time Unit speed reduced to zero. Character cannot Act |
| **Duration** | 15 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Contain+Added Effect, Time+Added Effect, Choco/Mog+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | DeSpell, White Wind, Angel Whisper |

#### Frog

Perhaps the worst of the transformation Statuses. Frog both reduces your attack power, as well as preventing you from using almost all of your Materia. The only options available are Fight, Item, and if equipped, the Magic Spell 'Toad'. You can't even perform Limit Breaks while transformed into a frog.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character is a frog! |
| **Effects** | All Physical attacks do 1/4 of Base Damage. Character can only use Fight (not Limit), Item (including W-Item) or cast Toad |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, White Cape, Transform+Added Effect, Hades+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper, Toad, Maiden's Kiss, Impaler |

#### Small

While not as bad as Frog, this is still a terrible condition. While Magic is still wide open to you, every physical attack will have an Attack of 0; you will do 1 HP damage until modifications added after the random variation are added.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character size is significantly reduced |
| **Effects** | Character Attack reduced to 0 |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, White Cape, Transform+Added Effect, Hades+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper, Mini, Cornucopia, Shrivel |

#### Slow-numb

One of the banes of the beginner player. Slow-numb can easily take out a character within moments if you're not prepared. It's essentially a countdown to petrify; you have 30 units of time (shown by the counter above the character's head) to cure them, or end the battle. Otherwise, they are inflicted with Petrify.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character has timer above head/flashes Grey |
| **Effects** | 30-unit Timer set on character. When Timer reaches 0, Petrify is inflicted |
| **Duration** | 30 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Jem Ring, Safety Bit |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper, Soft |

#### Petrify

Completely turned to stone. You can't act, and you're flagged as 'Dead'; if everyone in your party is flagged as 'Dead', then the game is over. However, it's easily curable, and while Petrified, you cannot be inflicted with any other Status Attributes, or take damage in any way. However, you also can't have damage healed while Petrified.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character Animation speed paused/Character coloured Grey |
| **Effects** | Character cannot Act. Character flagged as 'Dead'. Voids all damage. Prevents Status changes |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Jem Ring, Safety Bit, Contain+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper, Soft |

#### Regen

An alternative to the standard healing spells. Regen has the potential to be greater than any of them, for half the cost of Cure3. However, its healing ability takes place over time, and it heals at a rate proportional to your current Max HP value. In addition, it has a short duration, and it can be DeSpelled.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character flashes Orange |
| **Effects** | Character steadily gains approximately 1/32 of their Max HP over each unit of time |
| **Duration** | 32 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist' |
| **Cured by** | DeSpell |

#### Barrier

A protective Status Attribute, and the first available to you. It halves the damage from all Physical attacks, but it has a limited duration. The time left for Barrier can be checked in the Barrier gauge in the left window, next to the character name.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Barrier gauge is active |
| **Effects** | Halves all Physical damage |
| **Duration** | 30 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist' |
| **Cured by** | DeBarrier, DeSpell |

#### MBarrier

The counterpart of Barrier. MBarrier simply halves the damage from all Magical attacks. The time left for MBarrier can be checked in the MBarrier gauge in the left window, next to the Character name.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | MBarrier gauge is active |
| **Effects** | Halves all Magical damage |
| **Duration** | 30 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist' |
| **Cured by** | DeBarrier, DeSpell |

#### Reflect

One of the most interesting Status Attributes. Reflect allows you to bounce away certain spells up to a maximum of four times per casting per character.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | None |
| **Effects** | Will reflect spells up to four times back at caster, or random enemy if caster is an ally. Will only reflect certain magical spells |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle or exhausted |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist' |
| **Cured by** | DeBarrier, DeSpell |

#### Shield

A very powerful defensive Status Attribute, second only to Peerless. It voids all normal attacks, and absorbs all Elemental Magic. However, it will not absorb Non-Elemental damage, and Items seem able to breach Shield and still cause full damage, whether they're Elemental items or not.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | None |
| **Effects** | Voids normal attacks. Absorbs Elemental Magic and Physical damage. Does not defend against Item damage or Non-Element Magic attacks |
| **Duration** | 17.5 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Resist' |
| **Cured by** | DeBarrier, DeSpell |

#### Death-sentence

A counter positioned above the character's head begins to count down to zero. If it reaches zero, then the Status Death is inflicted on the character, subject to protection from Death.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character kneels/has timer above head |
| **Effects** | 60-unit Timer set on character. When Timer reaches 0, Death is inflicted |
| **Duration** | 60 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', 'Death Force', Ribbon, Safety Bit |
| **Cured by** | None |

#### Manipulate

The only Status Attribute that cannot be used on your party. Using it on an enemy, if they're susceptible to it, will place the enemy under the character's command. Each character can only Manipulate one enemy at a time, and a single Physical hit will free the enemy from your control.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character flashes Cyan |
| **Effects** | Character is controlled by whomever used Manipulate on them |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Resist', 'Sleep', 'Stop', 'Paralysed' |
| **Cured by** | Any Physical hit, White Wind |

#### Berserk

A risky Status Attribute. On the plus side, a character under this Attribute hits harder than usual with every attack. But on the minus, they cannot be controlled, and they randomly attack the enemy any time they can. It is also impossible to Critical Strike when under Berserk Status. Berserk has another use; it's an effective alternative to Silence when used on the enemy.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character flashes Red |
| **Effects** | Character's Physical Damage is multiplied by 1.5. Character attacks random Enemy with Physical Attack. Impossible to get Critical Strikes |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Peace Ring, Mystify+Added Effect |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper |

#### Peerless

The ultimate defensive Status Attribute. Unfortunately, only one character has the ability to use this: Aeris. When used, it fully voids all damage of any type, as well as acting like Resist with regards to Status Attributes. However, it has a limited duration, and the Void state makes it impossible to heal while under it.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character flashes Yellow |
| **Effects** | Voids all damage. Immune to all Status Attributes |
| **Duration** | 17.5 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Resist' |
| **Cured by** | None |

#### Paralysed

The least powerful of the temporary 'Can't Act' Status Attributes. It's still a pain at times. It acts almost exactly like Sleep and while it lasts for a very short time, you can't cure it with a simple Physical attack.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character kneels/Character animation speed paused |
| **Effects** | Character cannot Act |
| **Duration** | 8 units |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Jem Ring |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper |

#### Darkness

A nuisance at best. Darkness simply reduces your attack accuracy, causing you to miss more often. It's easily cured, and has little tactical use.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character kneels/flashes Black |
| **Effects** | Character Accuracy% reduced |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Silver Glasses, Fairy Ring |
| **Cured by** | Esuna, Remedy, White Wind, Angel Whisper, Eye drop |

#### Dual

This extremely rare Status only turns up during one battle: Bottomswell. Whenever Bottomswell uses Waterpolo at you, both Imprisoned and Dual are placed on you. Dual acts like a reverse Regen. HP is drained over time, requiring swift attention.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | None |
| **Effects** | Character steadily loses approximately 1/32 of their Max HP over each unit of time |
| **Duration** | Unknown |
| **Protected by** | Unknown |
| **Cured by** | Killing Waterpolo |

#### Death Force

A useful status which allows you to temporarily give yourself protection from Death until the end of the battle. Its usefulness stems from the fact that very few enemies actually use the Death Status. Recognize them, and you can spare an Accessory slot or a few Materia slots and just rely on Death Force when you need it. The disadvantage is that the immunity is temporary; if that character gets hit by DeSpell or White Wind or gets killed, they will lose the immunity immediately.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | None |
| **Effects** | Immune 'Death' |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | Unknown |
| **Cured by** | DeSpell, White Wind |

#### Resist

You are never given any indication of when you have Resist, but its effects are quickly apparent; any Status change is prevented. Unfortunately, that can also mean, for example, if you have Frog and then Resist is placed on you, you cannot cure Frog without removing Resist first. Its best use is to trap enemies with certain Status Attributes so that they can't heal themselves. As a secondary use, it can be a temporary defense against nasty Statuses, but it's expensive and not easy to remove.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | None |
| **Effects** | Immune to all Status Attributes |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | None |
| **Cured by** | DeSpell, White Wind |

#### Lucky Girl

Only one attack in the game can inflict this Status: Lucky Girl. This is one of the Limit Combinations in Cait Sith's Slot Limit. It causes all subsequent attacks to be Critical Strikes. However, this is offset by its rarity; most players will go through the game without ever seeing Lucky Girl.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | None |
| **Effects** | All attacks are automatic Critical Strikes |
| **Duration** | Unknown |
| **Protected by** | Unknown |
| **Cured by** | None |

#### Imprisoned

The final temporary 'Can't Act' Status. The temporary nature of this status is dependant on what is causing it; various enemies have a few ways of dealing out this attribute, and each requires its own method of removing it. The character is flagged as 'Dead'. It is easily the worst of the four 'Can't Act' Statuses.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Visuals** | Character Animation speed paused |
| **Effects** | Character cannot Act. Character flagged as 'Dead'. Character cannot be targeted by attacks/spells |
| **Duration** | Until end of battle |
| **Protected by** | None |
| **Cured by** | Killing Pyramid, Waterpolo or Left Arm/Right Arm |

### 4.2 Special Notes On Statuses

#### Status Colours

The different colors you flash have a priority system. If you currently have a Status that has a higher priority than another one you have, you will flash the color of the higher priority Status:

| Priority | Status | Color |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Highest | Slow-numb | GREY |
| | Poison | GREEN |
| | Berserk | RED |
| | Peerless | YELLOW |
| | Darkness | BLACK |
| | Regen | ORANGE |
| Lowest | Manipulate | CYAN |

Thus, if your character has both Darkness and Berserk on them, they'll flash Red rather than Black, because Berserk is the more important one to know about.

#### Status Incompatibilities

Various statuses will cancel out other ones as soon as they're inflicted upon a character:

| Status Name | Cancels |
|-------------|---------|
| Death | All Status Attributes except Frog and Small |
| Sleep | Manipulate |
| Sadness | Fury |
| Fury | Sadness |
| Haste | Slow |
| Slow | Haste |
| Stop | Manipulate |
| Petrify | Slow-numb, Manipulate |
| Paralysed | Manipulate |

#### Removing Conditions

What follows are the various ways of removing multiple Status Attributes at the same time. Those not listed are self-explanatory. Also, if something cures Petrify, then it also cures Slow-numb.

> [!NOTE]
> Healing spells and effects work in strict order, first healing HP, then removing Status Attributes from the top down. Thus, White Wind takes two tries to remove, for example, Frog and Resist; the first time, it can't remove Frog because of Resist. The second try, Resist is gone, so it can finally remove Frog.

| Status Name | Esuna | Remedy | DeBarrier | DeSpell | White Wind | Angel Whisper |
|-------------|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
| Death | - | - | - | - | - | ✓ |

| Darkness | ✓ | ✓ | - | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| Death Force | - | - | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Resist | - | - | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |

**Holy Torch:** Cures everything DeSpell does except 'Death Force' and 'Resist'.

The following skills can be reflected using the Status Reflect.

**Reflectable Magic:**

| | | | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cure | Cure2 | Cure3 | Poisona | Esuna | Resist | Life | Life2 | Regen | Fire |

## 5. Game Over

There are a number of ways to lose the game, most of which can only occur in battle.

The most common way is to have all three characters in your battle party flagged as 'Dead'. This involves losing each of your characters to any of the following situations:

1. **Gaining the Status 'Death'**

2. **Gaining the Status 'Petrify'**

3. **Gaining the Status 'Imprisoned'**
   - Picked up by one of Carry Armor's arms
   - Surrounded by Reno's Pyramid or Bottomswell's Waterpolo
   - You must destroy whatever is imprisoning the character to bring them back

4. **Being knocked out of battle** by Eat (used by Hungry), Goanni (used by Ghost Ship) or Whirlsand (used by Ruby Weapon)
   - Note: Midgar Zolom's Blown Away, Scissors(Upper)'s Scissor Tornado and Gighee's Sun Diver all knock you out of battle, but flag the character as *escaped* instead of dead; if all other characters die or are knocked out, the battle itself will count as an escape.

If you are still flagged as 'Dead' at the end of a successful battle, then that character will gain no EXP or AP from the battle. However, the Status 'Death' is the only one that lasts into the next battle if you don't cure it.

**Special Cases:**

- **Emerald Weapon:** Running out of time (only occurs if you do not have the Underwater Materia equipped)
- **Battle Square, Five Gods Pagoda, or Fort Condor:** Losing a battle won't lose the game, just the battle
- **Mako Reactor 1 Mission:** Running out of time will automatically lose the game (without having to be in battle)

## 6. Credits

A large majority of the work here is my own... but there are some people that I feel it is necessary to mention on this long road.

**The Denizens of alt.games.final-fantasy.rpg:**
My old haunt. More a shout-out rather than credit, but hey, it's where I began, really ^_^ It's also where I met...

**Qhimm:**
...with whom I worked on the FF8 savemap with. Lots of fun, and we actually got something useful out of it: a working save editor that he programmed named Griever. It was also on his site that I met others who took the same interest in this field.

**The Denizens of Qhimm's Forum:**
The SaiNt. Ficedula. Alhexx. And *especially* L.Spiro. There were others, of course, but those are the names who stand out. Enemy Stats and Attack Properties would've been hell to compile without the effort made by those at Qhimm's Forum. I collected data myself, but understanding it? L.Spiro provided the first and most important step in deciphering the attack and enemy dumps.

And... that's that, really. Hope you've enjoyed the show.

## Appendix A: Enemy Battle Scenes (Scene.bin)

*Author: Fremen*
*Date: September 30, 2003*

FF7 keeps each enemy battle configuration in a file called "scene.bin":

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| PSX Version | `/DATA/BATTLE/SCENE.BIN` |
| PC Version | `/BATTLE/SCENE.BIN` |

This file is exactly the same in both versions. It holds all the battle configurations for all enemies encountered in the game.

> [!NOTE]
> These specifications are incomplete. If you have got any idea about the unknown data blocks, please let me know. :)

### Scene.bin File Structure

The scene.bin file contains **256 gzipped files** which give information for all the FF7 monsters.

The file is structured with blocks exactly **0x2000 bytes** in length. Blocks are concatenated with each other to form the scene.bin file.

**To extract data from scene.bin:**
1. Find the correct blocks
2. Extract the gzipped files from it
3. Ungzip those files → you'll find 256 files, each 7808 bytes

**Battle Number to Scene File Mapping:**
- We have 1024 possible battle numbers: 0 - 1023
- Each group of **4** Battle Numbers refers to a particular Scene file
- Battles 0-3 → File 0, Battles 4-7 → File 1, etc.

### Scene.bin Block Structure

**Block length: 0x2000 bytes**

| Offset | Length | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 0x0000 | 4 bytes | Pointer (in DWORD) of the first data file. `Offset = pointer × 4`. Pointer = 0xFFFFFFFF means end of block reached. |
| 0x0004 | 4 bytes | Second pointer. 0xFFFFFFFF = end of block. |
| 0x003C | 4 bytes | Last pointer. Usually 0xFFFFFFFF. |
| 0x0040 | 4 × (pointer2-pointer1) bytes | First data file (gzipped). Note: May end with 0xFF bytes, as size must be multiple of 4. |
| pointer2 × 4 | 4 × (pointer3-pointer2) bytes | Second data file (gzipped). |
| lastpointer × 4 | 4 × (0x2000-lastpointer) bytes | Last data file. Note: ~10 files per block. Ends with 0xFF bytes to reach 0x2000 bytes. |

## Appendix B: PSX 3D Battle Scenes

*Author: Micky*

Backgrounds are stored in probably the easiest model format used in FF7. They are stored in LZS files in the STAGE1 and STAGE2 directories, using the ff7-standard lzs compression.

### File Structure

The files begin with a directory:
- First word: number of sections
- One pointer for each section

Each section contains a mesh for the background, except:
- First section: unknown data
- Last section: TIM-format texture and palettes

Each section starts with vertex data, followed by triangle and quad data.

### Vertex Data Format

```text
1 u32    size of vertex data
8 bytes per vertex:
  3 u16  x, y, z
  1 u16  pad(?)
```

### Triangle Data Format

```text
1 u16    number of triangles
1 u16    texture page (among other flags)
16 bytes per triangle:
  3 u16  offset into vertex table
  1 u16  unknown
  2 u8   u1, v1
  1 u16  palette (and some other flags)
  2 u8   u2, v2
  2 u8   u3, v3
```

### Quad Data Format

```text
1 u16    number of quads
1 u16    texture page (among other flags)
20 bytes per quad:
  4 u16  offset into vertex table
  2 u8   u1, v1
  1 u16  palette
  2 u8   u2, v2
  2 u8   u3, v3
  2 u8   u4, v4
  1 u16  unknown
```

> [!NOTE]
> Displaying the backgrounds is a bit tricky on modern graphics boards, as they don't support palletized textures anymore. This is understandable given the large number of fetches required for displaying a properly filtered texture - but not very helpful. I solved that by a pre-process that stores the palette on each pixel and then looks up the color during export.

## Appendix C: PSX Battle Models Structure

### Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| BYTE | Unsigned 8 bit binary string |
| WORD | Unsigned 16 bit binary string |
| DOUBLE WORD | Unsigned 32 bit binary string |

Values are SIGNED if they say so, otherwise assume unsigned.

Many of the PSX data files use LZS compression.

### Combat Models Directory Structure

Combat Models occupy directories on the CD:
- ENEMY1
- ENEMY2
- ENEMY3
- ENEMY4
- ENEMY5
- ENEMY6

ENEMY6 contains the character models and their weapons, including the hires version of Cloud and Sephiroth.

### Model Format

The first 4 bytes of the LZS file contains the uncompressed size of the LZS compressed data, as a double word. The actual compressed data follows.

After decompression, the model structure is:
- First double word: number of sections (SEC_COUNT)
- Following SEC_COUNT double words: array of offsets to data sections

```c
/* Format information */
[ DOUBLE WORD ] Section Count
[ DOUBLE WORD ] OFFSET SECTION 1
[ DOUBLE WORD ] OFFSET SECTION 2
...
[ DOUBLE WORD ] OFFSET SECTION N
```

### Section Identification

- **Section 1:** The actual model information
- **TIM Image:** Always present (must be found before processing the model)
- **Sections 2 to before TIM:** Animation sequences (nearly identical to PC format)
- **16 sections past TIM (character models):** Weapon models (same format as section 1)

For models with no textures, the TIM image consists of a 16 entry palette and a 1 unit tall, 0 units wide, 4 bits per pixel image.

### Section 1 Format (Bone Structure)

The beginning of the section is the BONE COUNT. The ROOT BONE follows this (NOT counted as a bone, and is ALL ZEROs).

```c
typedef struct {
    UINT16 Parent;
    INT16 Length;
    UINT32 Offset;
} FF7_BONE;
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Parent | 0 = root bone (always relative to itself) |
| Length | Always negative, draw with this in mind |
| Offset | From section beginning to polygon data (0 = JOINT, no physical shape) |

Objects are drawn from parent to child.

### Physical Shape Data

The bone offset points to a double word whose value is:
- `× 8` = vertex count
- Or: SIZE in bytes of the vertex pool (always multiple of 8)

After the vertex pool comes:
1. Texture triangle count and offset
2. Textured triangles

```c
typedef struct {
    UINT16 A;
    UINT16 B;
    UINT16 C;
    UINT16 D;
} FF7_POLY;

typedef struct {
    FF7_POLY Vertices;
    UINT8 U0, V0;
    UINT16 PAL;
    UINT8 U1, V1;
    UINT8 U2, V2;
} FF7_TTRI;
```

FF7_POLY is a list of offsets into the Vertex pool. Square follows the **LEFT HAND RULE** for ordering to know which way the surface is facing.

**Textured Quads:**

```c
typedef struct {
    FF7_POLY Vertices;
    UINT8 U0, V0;
    UINT16 PAL;
    UINT8 U1, V1;
    UINT8 U2, V2;
    UINT8 U3, V3;
    UINT16 ZZ1;
} FF7_TQUAD;
```

> [!NOTE]
> On ALL quads in the PSX version, the ordering of the vertices is **A B D C** (not A B C D). This is a result of the hardware on the PSX rendering a quadric using 2 triangles. To compute the palette number: `(PAL >> 7) & 7`

**Colored Vertex Triangles:**

```c
typedef struct {
    UINT8 R;
    UINT8 G;
    UINT8 B;
    UINT8 U;
} FF7_CLR;

typedef struct {
    FF7_POLY Vertices;
    FF7_CLR Colors[3];
} FF7_TRI;
```

**Colored Vertex Quadrics:**

```c
typedef struct {
    FF7_POLY Vertices;
    FF7_CLR Colors[4];
} FF7_QUAD;
```

Same A B D C ordering as textured quads.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The TIM image contains palette data (often 1-3 palettes). Some textures have transparent pixels that use palette entry with bit 15 set (transparency bit on PSX).

## Appendix D: PC Battle Models Structure

*Author: Mirex*

Final Fantasy 7 battle models are stored in file `battle.lgp` under `FF7/DATA/BATTLE` directory. Data can be unpacked by Unmass (http://mirex.mypage.sk) or LGPtools (http://ficedula.cjb.net).

### File Classification

The LGP file contains many small files with 4-letter long filenames:

| First 2 letters | Type |
|-----------------|------|
| aa-of | Enemy models |
| og-rr | Battle scenes |
| rs-sm | Player models |

Example: files starting with 'rt' belong to Cloud's model.

### File Types by 3rd-4th Characters

| Characters | Type |
|------------|------|
| aa | Skeleton information |
| ab | Unknown |
| ac-al | Textures (.TEX files) |
| am-cj | Body parts (.P files) |
| ck-cz | Player's weapons (.P files) |
| da | Animations files |

Example: 'rtck' = Cloud's first weapon (Buster sword) because 'rt' = Cloud, 'ck' = 1st weapon.

### Summon Models

Stored in `magic.lgp` with different filenames:
- Models (P-files): `creature.p??`
- Textures: `creature.t??`
- Skeleton info: `creature.d`
- Animations: `creature.a??`

### 'AA' - Skeleton File Structure

```c
// offset
struct FF7AAheader {
    unsigned long u1[3];      // 0
    unsigned long bones;      // 12 - number of model bones
    unsigned long u2[3];      // 16
    unsigned long a;          // 28
    unsigned long b;          // 32 - maybe number of body part models
    unsigned long u3[4];      // 36
}; // size is 52 bytes

struct FF7AAbone {
    long parent;              // 0 - index of parent bone, -1 = root node
    float length;             // 4 - length of bone, always negative
    unsigned long model;      // 8 - 1=has body part, 0=no body part
}; // size is 12 bytes
```

If bone's parent is -1, it begins at center of coordinate system. Otherwise, it is a child of its parent bone.

### 'DA' - Animations File Structure

```c
struct s_FF7AAanimHdr {
    unsigned long rec_a;           // 0
    unsigned long rec_b;           // 4
    unsigned long block_len;       // 8
    unsigned short block_a;        // 12
    unsigned short real_data_len;  // 14
    unsigned short translat[3];    // 16
    unsigned char u1;              // 22
}; // size = 23 bytes
```

**File structure:**
1. 4 bytes: number of animations
2. For each animation: FF7AAanimHdr structure followed by animation data

Animation data size = `FF7AAanimHdr.block_len - 11`

### Animation Data Format

Rotation angles for each bone are stored as **12-bit integers** (not 4-byte floats):
- 1 integer = 1.5 bytes
- 3 angles (rotations for one bone) = 4.5 bytes
- 10 bones = 45 bytes

**Conversion:**
- 0 euler = 0 degrees
- 4096 euler = 360 degrees
- Formula: `degrees = euler × 360 / 4096`

**Example Rotation Data:**

Data in hex: `DC BF FE 00 3E`

| Hex | D | C | B | F | F | E | 0 | 0 | 3 | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bin | 1101 | 1100 | 1011 | 1111 | 1111 | 1110 | 0000 | 0000 | 0011 | 1110 |

| Axis | Hex Value | Decimal (euler) | Degrees |
|------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| X | DCB | 3531 | 310.3° |
| Y | FFE | 4094 | 359.8° |
| Z | 003 | 3 | 0.2° |

> [!NOTE]
> The animation data are not understood well yet, so usually only first frame and few other frames look as they should when you read them this way.
