Standardization Changes Applied:
- Added YAML frontmatter with LLM routing metadata
- Fixed heading hierarchy: H1 title cleaned (removed anchor syntax)
- Removed wiki-style TOC link with non-standard attributes
- Converted {=html} pandoc artifacts to clean markdown (bold/italic)
- Standardized section headings for proper H1→H2→H3→H4 flow
- Preserved all technical hex data and offset information exactly
- Cleaned up horizontal rule formatting (underscores to standard ---)
- Removed escaped characters (\' to ') for readability
- v2.0: Added GitHub-flavored markdown alerts
- v2.0: Improved code block language tags
- v2.0: Enhanced table alignment

LLM CONTEXT BLOCK (Read this first for routing decisions):
This document specifies the BSZ binary format used for world map character models in Final Fantasy VII.
WM0.BSZ contains Cloud's model, WM1.BSZ is Tifa's, WM2.BSZ is Cid's, and WM3.BSZ contains other characters.
The format closely resembles BCX field model format, enabling similar custom model creation techniques.
Key sections include header (offsets to model/texture data), model section (bones, parts, animations),
and texture data. Also includes PC-specific encounter data format and world map area definitions.
Related to [[FF7_WorldMap_Module]] for overall world map architecture and [[FF7_World_Map_Encounters]]
for detailed encounter mechanics.

# FF7 World Map BSZ Format

## Overview

[Lazy Bastard]: Using a hex editor, I've mapped out a BSZ file, namely WM0.BSZ - Cloud's world map model. Incidentally, WM1.BSZ is Tifa's world map model, WM2.BSZ is Cid's, and WM3.BSZ seems to be every other world map model, similar to a BSX in fields (though I haven't confirmed this yet).

> [!NOTE]
> There is a remarkable resemblance here to BCX format, so custom world map models can be created using the same techniques used for field models. See Qhimm.com forum threads for implementation details.

Akari: Perhaps you can use this data to implement a utility and functionality in Q-Gears?

## PSX Memory Layout

In PSX memory, WM0.BSZ starts at `0x14A600` (and ends at `0x14F3B7`). Every 80-type offset in this file can be treated as such:

> **Offset conversion formula:** `offset - 0x8014A600 = in-file offset`

## BSZ Header Section

**BSZ Header Section** at offset `0x00000000`:

### Unknown Field

Unknown (always the same) at offset `0x00000000`:

```hex
02 00 00 00 08 00 00 00
```

### Texture Data Offset

Relative offset from end of 'BSZ Header Section' to 'Texture Data Section' at offset `0x00000008`:

```hex
5C 47 00 00
```

### Model Section Offset

Offset to Model Section, Header (offset minus `0x8014A600` equals file offset) at offset `0x00000010`:

```hex
18 A6 14 80
```

### Unknown Offset

Relative offset from end of 'BSZ Header Section' to Unknown at offset `0x00000014`:

```hex
54 47 00 00
```

> 'BSZ Header Section' runs until 'Model Section'.

## Related: PC Format and Encounter System

### World Map Encounter Data Format (PC)

#### PC Format Details

By the way, also had a brief look at the World Map... although things are different between that and the field files, it naturally has many of the same data structures... dialogue's in 'mes', the event files are in 'wm0.ev', 'wm2.ev' and 'wm3.ev' (I assume... though I've not gotten any conclusive proof that this is the case through a *brief* glance through them), and the encounters are stored in 'enc_w.bin' (but may or may not follow the same rules regarding encounter chances... unsure yet)

---

Well, enough data to warrant its own post to follow.

Encounter data for the World Map starts at offset `0xB8`, and each section is 32 bytes each. A section is defined as follows:

| Offset      | Size     | Description                                              |
|:------------|:---------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x00`      | 1 byte   | Always `01`                                              |
| `0x01`      | 1 byte   | Encounter Rate (lower numbers = higher encounter rates)  |
| `0x02-0x0D` | 12 bytes | Normal Battle + Chance (2 bytes each, 6 records)         |
| `0x0E-0x15` | 8 bytes  | Special Formation Battles + Chance (2 bytes each, 4 records) |
| `0x16-0x1F` | 10 bytes | Chocobo Battles (2 bytes each, 5 records)                |

> [!NOTE]
> Again, the chance byte for normal battles seems to always add up to 64.

### World Map Areas and Terrain

Anyhow, as for how they're *stored*...

...each area in the game has four fields, and they're aligned something like this:

| Terrain Type   | Description                  |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------|
| Grass          | Standard grass terrain       |
| Dirt/Snow      | Dirt or snow covered areas   |
| Forest/Desert  | Forested or desert regions   |
| Beach          | Coastal beach areas          |

And the areas are naturally in this order:

1. **Midgar Area**
2. **Kalm Area**
3. **Junon Area**
4. **Corel Area**
5. **Gold Saucer Area**
6. **Gongaga Area**
7. **Cosmo Area**
8. **Nibel Area**
9. **Rocket Area**
10. **Wutai Area**
11. **Woodlands Area**
12. **Icicle Area** (Not sure what Forest is for this, since the forests in this area are supposed to have no encounters)
13. **Mideel Area**
14. **North Corel Area** (Materia Cave north of Corel)(?)
15. **Cactus Island**
16. **Goblin Island** (Goblin Island lacks a full empty Beach encounter list)
