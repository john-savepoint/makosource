MERGE METADATA
Created: 2025-11-30 18:33 JST
Original: FF7_PSX_Sound.md (container file)
Purpose: Category/container page for PSX Sound subsections
Status: Container file for TOC navigation
Session-ID: 6f8970e0-023d-45dc-b3d8-5c9f9a8ff58e

Standardization Changes Applied:
- Added YAML frontmatter with LLM routing metadata
- Added HTML comment standardization metadata block
- Converted 4 wiki-style links to standard markdown format
- Verified heading hierarchy (H1→H2 is correct for this index file)
- Added detailed cross-references to subsection documentation
- Enhanced subsection descriptions for better LLM navigation

LLM CONTEXT BLOCK (Read this first for routing decisions):
This is a container/index document for the PSX Sound module. It provides navigation
to four specialized subsections covering PlayStation audio implementation in FF7:
the system overview, instrument data formats (INSTRx.DAT and INSTRx.ALL), and
AKAO audio sequence specifications. For technical details about any audio topic,
route to the specific subsection file rather than this index page.

# PSX Sound

This section covers the PlayStation audio system used in Final Fantasy VII. The PSX sound architecture includes instrument banks, AKAO audio sequences, and the proprietary sound format developed for the PlayStation hardware.

## Subsections

The PSX Sound documentation is organized into the following specialized topics:

### Overview

- [PSX Sound Overview](FF7_PSX_Sound_Overview.md) - High-level introduction to the PSX sound system architecture and how FF7 utilizes PlayStation audio hardware.

### Instrument Data Formats

- [INSTRx.DAT Format](FF7_PSX_Sound_INSTRxDAT.md) - Instrument data file format specification detailing the record structure for individual instrument definitions.

- [INSTRx.ALL Format](FF7_PSX_Sound_INSTRxALL.md) - Instrument archive format specification covering the container structure that holds multiple instrument data files.

### Audio Sequence Format

- [AKAO Frames](FF7_PSX_Sound_AKAO_frames.md) - Comprehensive AKAO audio sequence format documentation including frame structure, channel info, opcodes, and field script invocation methods.
