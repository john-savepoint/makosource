Merge decision: COMPLETE - Content merged and verified
Reason: Direct match for engine overview - canonical content from major section integrated
Status: COMPLETE - All content extracted, images adjusted, markers added
Session: 552a7ee9-e42e-4439-8243-2eb1a43110da

Standardization Changes Applied:
- Added YAML frontmatter with LLM routing metadata
- Added HTML comment metadata block with standardization history
- Converted wiki-style TOC links to standard markdown anchors
- Standardized image path from ../../images/ to ../images/ (relative to final/ directory)
- Removed duplicate image at end of document (same image appeared twice)
- Removed extraction marker comments (integrated into metadata block)
- Added descriptive alt text to image

LLM CONTEXT BLOCK (Read this first for routing decisions):
This document provides the foundational overview of Final Fantasy VII's game engine architecture.
It explains how the engine is divided into six distinct modules (kernel, field, menu, world map,
battle, mini game) to manage PlayStation's limited 1MB VRAM and 2MB system RAM. The field module
serves as the primary game driver with scripting capabilities to invoke other modules. This is
essential reading for understanding how different parts of FF7 interact and why certain game
behaviors exist (e.g., why you cannot access the menu from battle). For detailed information on
specific modules, see the related documentation files listed in the frontmatter.

## Parts of the Engine

The engine used to power Final Fantasy 7 is split into several modules. This allowed the programming team to break apart into very distinct groups. It also created a very diverse game playing environment. It also allowed the artists to only have to work within their own module, keeping the artwork as dynamic as possible.

The module system allowed for a single point of entry into, and exit out of, each distinct part of the game. The PSX, which the game was originally developed for, had very limited resources. With only 1 megabyte of video ram and 2 megabytes of system ram, data had to be banked in and out efficiently. Modules were a clean way to dump whole parts of the engine to make way for other parts.

The core system is made up of six modules. They are called the kernel, field, menu, world map, battle, and mini game. They are arranged in the following order:

## Generic Program Flow

Not every module is accessible by every other module. There is a distinct flow between them. For example, you can not access the menu from battle, much to the chagrin of the poor user who had forgotten to equip some last minute item. The field module, second only to the kernel, drives the game. It includes a powerful scripting system that can call any module within the game.
