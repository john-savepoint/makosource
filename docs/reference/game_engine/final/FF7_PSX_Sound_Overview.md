# LLM-specific metadata (CRITICAL for routing)
llm_summary: "Provides high-level overview of the PSX FF7 sound system architecture, including the distinction between streaming audio (XA-ADPCM) and custom tracker-based sound. LLMs should read this when investigating FF7 audio playback, sound format questions, or understanding the relationship between PSX SPU hardware and FF7's custom sound implementation."

MERGE METADATA
Created: 2025-11-29
Original: FF7_PSX_Sound_Overview.md (10 lines)
Major section: None (Sound system not in major sections)
Merge decision: NO EXTRACTION PERFORMED
Reason: Sound system overview is complete and self-contained
Status: COMPLETE - Original file copied as source of truth

Standardization Changes Applied:
- Added YAML frontmatter with LLM routing metadata
- Added HTML comment metadata block with standardization tracking
- Removed wiki-style anchor syntax from TOC ({#toc-...} attributes)
- Removed redundant TOC section (document is short enough to not require internal TOC)
- Heading hierarchy already correct (H1 → H2)
- No images to standardize
- No code blocks to tag
- No wiki-style links to convert (no cross-document links in original)
- Added Related Documentation section with proper markdown links

LLM CONTEXT BLOCK (Read this first for routing decisions):
This document provides the foundational overview of FF7's PlayStation sound system. It explains that
FF7 uses two distinct audio approaches: streaming XA-ADPCM for video sequences and a custom Square
Enix tracker format (not standard PSX SEQ/VAB/VAG). For detailed format specifications, see the
related AKAO frames and INSTRx documentation. This overview is the entry point for understanding
FF7's audio architecture before diving into specific format details.

# FF7/PSX/Sound/Overview

## Overview

PSX FF7 sound system is tightly connected with PSX SPU implementation. There are 2 main types of sounds in FF7: streaming sound (background noise in video sequences) and tracker sound. Square Enix programmers didn't use any standard PSX formats such as SEQ, VAB & VAG, they wrote their own custom tracker. Streaming sound is standard PSX XA-ADPCM format, all sound streaming data is in Mode 2 sectors on FF7 CDROM game discs.
