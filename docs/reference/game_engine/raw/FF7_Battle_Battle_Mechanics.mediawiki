= FF7/Battle/Battle Mechanics =

This page will be for Battle memory structures. This is consistent with the memory structure of the PC version. PSX may or may not reflect these structures.

== Command Defaults ==

Each command type has default execution values that can, in some cases, be overridden. These come from a hard-coded structure in the executable.

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset
! Default
|-
| 0h
| Animation
|-
| 1h
| Damage Calculation
|-
| 2h
| Command Properties
|}

== Queued Actions ==

When a command is selected either by a player character or an enemy the action is inserted into a priority queue. Up to 64 actions can be queued. On each update loop, the main Queue function will pop off the next action with the lowest priority and execute it in FIFO order within priority bands. 

Queue entries have the following structure in memory:

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset
! Value
|-
| 0
| Action Priority (limits/counters 0, player chosen spells 6)
|-
| 1
| Queue position within priority band
|-
| 2
| Attacker actor ID
|-
| 3
| Action command index (e.g CMD_MAGIC = 0x02)
|-
| 4
| Action attack index (e.g Bolt = 0x21). (This index is absolute, not command relative)
|-
| 6
| Action target mask
|}

== AI Structure ==

There is a single block of memory that holds AI information on the current running script. Each Actor "owns" this while their scripts are executing.

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset

|-
| 0h
| Actor Index
|-

|-

|-

|-

|-
| 24h

|-

|-
| 2Ah
| Mask of ''non-null'' values in Group 2
|-
| 2Ch - 50h
| Group 1 of variables
|-
| 54h - 78h

|-
| 7Ch - 27Ch

== Active Character Data ==

This is an array that each playable character maintains an instance of.

== Actor Battle Data ==

Similar to Active Character Data, but more detailed. This data is dependent on who is performing the current action and only one instance of it exists during each action and all stats are relative to the performing actor and current action unless otherwise noted. Addresses 200h and above will change for each target of the action.
