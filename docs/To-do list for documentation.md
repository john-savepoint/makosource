Still need to update the other documentation to the same standard of the Battle Animation PC we worked on today. Then we need to make sure all of those files have correct front matter and table of contents, as well as their images are in the correct places. Then we need to make a master combined document. The small individual documents need to be paired off against the FFNx Japanese Implementation Master Bible. Ideally, we have three main documents: the 7th Heaven Developer Guide, FFNx Developer Guide, and the FF7 Developer Guide. Other things like AF3DN analysis, multi-language findings, the tool guide, and PR737 analysis. These all need to be combined into these three somehow, and then we're going to shard those so they're easily searchable by an LLM.

Be able to add animated title screen and character art.
